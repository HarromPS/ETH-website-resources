                The Internet,we know,is deeply skewed towards content in English and other languages of the global
                North.
                Wikipedia is not immune to these inequalities,and this was a topic of fervent discussion at this years
                Wikimania,which recently concluded at Gdansk in Poland.
                It is an annual gathering,organised by the Wikimedia Foundation,of Wikipedia contributors who meet and
                discuss the state of various projects,and chart a course for the future.

                What was dramatic was the scale of the Wikimedia Foundations plans.
                It aims to increase reach to 680 million unique visitors globally by 2015 (from the current 388
                million).
                The aim is to achieve a 12 per cent annual growth in the global South,and 4 per cent annual growth in
                the global North; in other words,
                India figures large in Wikipedias next growth spurt.

                Within 90 days of its establishment, the Task Force produced an extensive background report on the state
                of technology in India and an IT Action Plan with 108 recommendations. The Task Force could act quickly
                because it built upon the experience and frustrations of state governments, central government agencies,
                universities, and the software industry. Much of what it proposed was also consistent with the thinking
                and recommendations of international bodies like the World Trade Organization (WTO), International
                Telecommunication Union (ITU), and World Bank. In addition, the Task Force incorporated the experiences
                of Singapore and other nations, which implemented similar programs. It was less a task of invention than
                of sparking action on a consensus that had already evolved within the networking community and
                government.

                AI is used to target web advertisements to those most likely to click or engage on them. It is also used
                to increase time spent on a website by selecting attractive content for the viewer. It can predict or
                generalize the behavior of customers from their digital footprints.

                Online gambling companies use AI to improve customer targeting.

                Personality computing AI models add psychological targeting to more traditional social demographics or
                behavioral targeting.AI has been used to customize shopping options and personalize offers.

                Games have been a major application[relevant?] of AI's capabilities since the 1950s. In the 21st
                century, AIs have produced superhuman results in many games, including chess (Deep Blue), Jeopardy!
                (Watson), Go (AlphaGo),poker (Pluribus and Cepheus), E-sports (StarCraft),and general game playing
                (AlphaZero and MuZero). AI has replaced hand-coded algorithms in most chess programs. Unlike go or
                chess, poker is an imperfect-information game, so a program that plays poker has to reason under
                uncertainty. The general game players work using feedback from the game system, without knowing the
                rules.
